# HttpServer
This is my educational project, implementation of concurrent http/REST server on core Java. Project builds via Maven. It's kinda mini-framework. If you choose it to be your server, you should implement Controller interface and use annotations for request mapping pretty similar to Spring MVC-framework.
See following example:

This module has strong dependency on my another educational module - LoggingMech, so you should add that to your local Maven repository if you want to start and check server.
